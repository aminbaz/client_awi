This is a nunjucks template file (see https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/).

This file is executed once, because it is in db directory. It is passed db variable. db variable is a pg-structure
object. Documentation for pg-structure can be found on http://www.pg-structure.com

This file's name is also a template. Strings between single curly braces are replaced during file generation.
{db.name} is replaced with name of the database. Filters are supported in file name templates too. If you change
this template's name to {db.name | camelCase} you'll see generated file name is in camelCase format. For example
"customer_survey" becomes customerSurvey.

Below is messages from template's index.js.

{{ messageAll }}
{{ message }}

Below is nunjucks loop iterating schemas of {{ db.name }} database:

{% for schema in db.schemas.array %}
    "{{ db.name }}" has "{{ schema.name }}" schema.
{% endfor %}

Also it is possible to iterate all tables via nested loops:

{% for schema in db.schemas.array %}
    {% for table in schema.tables.array -%}
    {{ schema.name }}.{{ table.name }}
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

Filters are modifiers for template strings. For example below is a list of all table name in camel case:

{% for schema in db.schemas.array %}
    {% for table in schema.tables.array -%}
        {{ schema.name | camelCase }}.{{ table.name | camelCase }}
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
